Noisebridge's Anti-Harrassment Policy
=====================================

This is a place for Noisebridge to collaborate on our anti-harassment
policy during the three-month-ish provisional period. File issues and
make pull requests, but please don't merge your own changes.

=====================================

Noisebridge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
housing status, or language. We do not tolerate harassment or abuse of people in our space or in writing, in any form.

"Harassment" includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, persistent uninvited communication, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Different users of Noisebridge have different levels of comfort about 
sex and porn. Nobody should be forced to experience sexual or 
sexualised language or imagery. This does not mean that such material 
is prohibited, just that such conversations, presentations, &c. should 
include only interested and consenting people.

When you are working on a sex- or porn-related project at Noisebridge, 
or are running such an event or presentation, provide reasonable 
notice and warning to allow others the opportunity to opt out if they 
wish. With this — as anything else — each person has a responsibility 
to be considerate of the comfort levels of others. Discussions, 
projects, and events of this nature should strive to exist in a 
culture of respect and consent.

"Abuse" is words or actions intended to hurt another person, including verbal insults, belittling or trivializing comments, and physical assault. 

People asked to stop any harassing or abusive behavior are expected to comply
immediately and permanently.

Physical assualt is a more severe violation, and will result in immediate, permanent expulsion. 

People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
space or the event at the discretion of any Noisebridge member.
